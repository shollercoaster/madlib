I had a _ (weird/exciting/scary) dream last night. 
It was my _ (geography/ french/ maths) professor back from school. 
If you remember, she was pretty _ (strict/ moody/ irky/ hot-tempered) back in those days.
And we were pretty _ (scared/ annoyed/ nonchalant) of her. 
So in my dream, we were back in school, and it was the last day and I was sitting on the _ (first/ last/ middle) bench. 
We had to submit our notebook and _ (final project/ home-cooked meal/ heartfelt poem) for grading, and I had forgotten to bring both! 
I was extremely _ (petrified/ relaxed/ melancholic), as you'd expect me to be. 
I was awaiting her _ (temper tantrum/ violent tendencies/ blessings/ excitement) on seeing me as a defaulter. 
When she came to my seat, I racked my brains up for a/an _ ( magic trick/ excuse/ table flip) to distract her. 
Suddenly, through the window came a _ (cute cat/ santa clause/ hideous raccoon/ the professor's daughter), and sat down on her lap! 
The professor was easily _ (amused/ irritated/ aroused) by the whole ordeal and forgot about me, as I quickly exited the premises!
